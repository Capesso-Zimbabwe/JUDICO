# JUDICO Accounting System

This document describes the comprehensive accounting system implemented in the JUDICO project, which provides professional-grade financial management capabilities specifically designed for law firms.

## Overview

The accounting system follows standard double-entry bookkeeping principles and includes:

- **Chart of Accounts**: Law firm specific account structure with proper categorization
- **Journal Management**: Multiple journal types for different transaction categories
- **Period Management**: **COMPLETELY MANUAL** - you create periods only when you need them
- **Financial Reporting**: Trial Balance, Balance Sheet, and Income Statement
- **Period Closing**: Automated closing entries and balance carry-forward

## System Architecture

### Core Models

1. **Account**: Chart of accounts with balance tracking
2. **Journal**: Transaction journals (General, Sales, Purchase, etc.)
3. **AccountingPeriod**: **Manual periods** - you control when and which to create
4. **JournalEntry**: Individual journal entries with posting controls
5. **JournalEntryLine**: Individual line items within journal entries
6. **AccountBalance**: Period-by-period balance tracking
7. **FinancialStatement**: Generated financial reports

### Account Structure

The chart of accounts follows standard numbering conventions specifically for law firms:

- **1000-1999**: Assets (Cash, Trust Accounts, Equipment, Buildings, etc.)
- **2000-2999**: Liabilities (Accounts Payable, Trust Liabilities, Loans, etc.)
- **3000-3999**: Equity (Partner Capital, Retained Earnings, etc.)
- **4000-4999**: Revenue (Legal Services by Practice Area, Consulting, etc.)
- **5000-5999**: Expenses (Legal Staff, Professional Development, Court Costs, etc.)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations finance_management
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Set Up Initial Data

```bash
python manage.py setup_accounting
```

This command creates:

- Default journals (General, Sales, Purchase, etc.)
- Law firm specific chart of accounts
- **IMPORTANT**: NO accounting periods are created automatically

### 3. Create Accounting Periods (ONLY WHEN NEEDED)

**The system will NEVER create periods automatically. You have complete control.**

#### When You Need Periods

- **Start of a new year**: Create periods for 2026, 2027, 2034, etc.
- **Start of a new business**: Create periods for your first year
- **Change in business structure**: Create new periods as needed

#### How to Create Periods

**Option 1: Django Admin (Recommended)**

```
/admin/finance_management/accountingperiod/
```

- Full control over period names, dates, and settings
- Visual interface for easy management

**Option 2: Command Line**

```bash
# Create monthly periods for 2026
python manage.py create_periods 2026

# Create quarterly periods for 2026
python manage.py create_periods 2026 --quarterly

# Create with adjustment period
python manage.py create_periods 2026 --adjustment
```

**Option 3: Application Interface**

- Use the web interface to create periods
- Full control over all period settings

#### List Existing Periods

```bash
# List all periods
python manage.py list_periods

# List only active periods
python manage.py list_periods --active-only

# List current period
python manage.py list_periods --current
```

#### Clear All Periods (Start Fresh)

```bash
# Clear all existing periods (use with caution)
python manage.py clear_periods --confirm
```

### 4. Verify Setup

Check the Django admin panel to ensure:

- Journals are created and active

- **No periods exist until you create them manually**
